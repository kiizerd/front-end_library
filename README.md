# js_library
Library project for The Odin Project JavaScript curriculum
---
This small library site allows users to add books from a modal form to a list that is then displayed in the browser.  
I coded it with vanilla JavaScript and some Bootstrap for styling.  
Click on book card to display information about the book.
